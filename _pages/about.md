    <th colspan="3">• The main objective of the project is archaeological exploration and heritage preservation using SAR remote sensing. There are numerous buried archaeological sites in arid regions of China and in the outskirts and rural areas of the Rome Province in Italy. Various SAR data from different platforms with different wavelengths and spatial resolutions are employed to test the signal penetration capability for identifying cultural heritage sites. Additionally, InSAR technology is utilized to assess the stability of the detected cultural heritage. <br>• Responsible for research involving the fusion of multi-source SAR data and predictive models for soil consolidation. Long-term dynamic monitoring of ancient buildings and large archaeological sites in cultural heritage preservation requires an assessment of both the main structures and their surrounding environments, with ground subsidence and structural deformation being crucial elements. Furthermore, some historical sites in the Rome area are built on soft soil foundations. Therefore, my research will also provide methodological and technical support for future research on cultural heritage preservation in both Wuhan and Rome urban areas for our collaborators.</th>

    <th colspan="3">• The main research objective of this project is to effectively detect the extensive accumulation-induced landslides that have developed during the long geological evolution of the Three Gorges Reservoir area. The goal is to prevent and minimize the damage and losses caused by landslide disasters. This will be achieved by combining InSAR, deep learning, and geological knowledge to predict, forecast, and assess landslides effectively.<br>• Responsible for the fusion of multi-platform SAR data to obtain the longest time series of deformation curves in the Three Gorges Reservoir area. I have proposed a novel method for multi-source data fusion, addressing the inaccuracies associated with traditional fusion methods and the challenge of fusing data with non-overlapping regions. This approach provides the project with a valuable long-time series of point-based data for deep learning research.</th>
